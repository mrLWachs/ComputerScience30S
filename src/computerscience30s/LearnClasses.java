        // =====================================================================        
        // A class is a way in code to combine properties and methods. Classes 
        // can also "communicate" with other classes, and they are used to 
        // model "things" in the "real" world
        
        // =====================================================================
        // (2) PROPERTIES
        // =====================================================================        
        // Properties are things about the class, or descriptors, or 
        // adjectives (they can also be seen as "global variables" for the 
        // class)
        
        // =====================================================================
        // (3) METHODS
        // =====================================================================        
        // Methods are things the class can do, or actions, or verbs (they are 
        // written with parameters, return types, etc.)
