// NETBEANS TIPS:
// ==============
// (1)  To zoom in and out on the code, hold ALT and roll the mouse
// (2)  Double click the top of a tab to hide side windows or show them
// (3)  The curly brackets (braces, parenthesis) are important "{" and "}"
// (4)  Type "sout" and then press tab it fills (autocompletes) "System.out..."
// (5)  Click the green triangle on the top toolbar to run code
