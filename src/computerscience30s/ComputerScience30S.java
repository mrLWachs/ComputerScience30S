// NETBEANS TIPS:
// ==============
// (1)  Hold Alt + scroll mouse to zoom in and out on code
// (2)  Double click the top of a tab of code to make bigger or smaller
// (3)  Type in lowercase "sout" and hit TAB to write System.out....
// (4)  Words in capital letters and in blue are IMPORTANT code words, the words
//      in captial letters are powerful, they are a "class"
// (5)  Intellisense (autocomplete) can appear if you press "CTRL + SPACE"
