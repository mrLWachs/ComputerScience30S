// anything following the 2 slashes is a comment, until the end of the line

/*  
    This is for multiple line comments until it sees a star and a slash.
    So anything between slash star and start slash is considered a commment.
*/

// TIPS:
// (1) Hold Alt + scroll mouse to zoom in and out on code
// (2) Double click the top of a tab of code to make bigger or smaller
// (3) Type in lowercase "sout" and hit TAB to write System.out....
// (4) Words in capital letters and in blue are IMPORTANT code words
