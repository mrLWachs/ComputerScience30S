// NETBEANS TIPS:
// ==============
//
// UNIT 1: Introduction To Java.................................................
//
// (1)  To build a new Java coding project in NetBeans, start Netbeans
//      then click "File -> New Project..." and choose "Java with Ant" 
//      and "Java Application", then click "Next >" give your project
//      a name that makes sense and in a location you can remember
//      then click "Finish" ... start coding!
// (2)  To zoom in and out on the code, hold ALT and roll the mouse
// (3)  Double click the top of a tab to hide side windows or show them
// (4)  The curly brackets (braces, parenthesis) are important "{" and "}" so
//      do not remove them or an error may occur
// (5)  Click the green triangle on the top toolbar to run code
// (6)  Autocomplete (Intellisense) can appear if you press "CTRL + SPACE"
